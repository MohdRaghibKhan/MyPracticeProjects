When to Use Runnable :-

Multiple Inheritance: If your class needs to extend another class in addition to having the ability to be executed by a thread,
you should use Runnable. Java supports single inheritance, so a class can only extend one class. By implementing Runnable,
you can separate the task to be executed from the thread management.

Separation of Concerns: Using Runnable allows you to separate the task logic from the thread control. This can make your code more modular and 
easier to manage. when we talking about separation of task logic from thread control means keeping the code that defines actual logic of thread 
separated from how tread is executing & running 

Task Logic: The actual work or computation you want the thread to perform.
Thread Management: How the thread is created and started.
flexibility-

Using Runnable allows you to use the same task with different thread management strategies (e.g., different threads or thread pools).
You can pass Runnable instances to an ExecutorService for more control over thread execution and resource management.
Reuse and Composition: By implementing Runnable, you can pass the same Runnable instance to different Thread instances or use it with other
concurrent utilities, such as executors.

Enhanced Flexibility: With Runnable, you can work with Java's Executor framework (e.g., ExecutorService), which provides more flexible and powerful
thread management.

When to Use Thread :-
Simple Use Case: If your task is simple and you don't need to extend any other class, you can extend Thread.
 This approach is straightforward and easy to implement for simple scenarios.
 
When you extend the Thread class, you can add extra methods and state to your thread class. This approach can be useful if the thread needs
to maintain specific information or perform additional actions that are tightly coupled with the thread's execution.
 example -:  CustomThread class 

Custom State:

You can add instance variables to the thread class to keep track of state that is relevant to the thread's operation.
Additional Methods:

You can define additional methods that are specific to the thread's functionality.
Tight Coupling:

The state and methods are tightly integrated with the thread’s life cycle, which might be useful if these elements are closely related to the
 thread’s execution. 
 
 
 Summary -: 
 In modern Java programming, using Runnable with thread pools and the Executor framework is generally preferred for its flexibility and scalability.
 However, extending Thread can be useful for simple cases or when you want a more direct approach.
